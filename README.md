# Spartan HUD

This progaram finds the 3D coordinates of where your gun is pointing and projects a target reticle using Microsoft HoloLens.

Since HoloLens has yet to be released, this is just a console application that calculates the unknown coordinates.

## Windows
Open `Program.exe` to launch the console application.

## Mac
C# programs don't run natively on Macs, so Mono is needed. [Download here] (http://www.mono-project.com/download/).
Once Mono is installed, open Terminal and run:
```
mono .../Program.exe
```
